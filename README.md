_Simple Python 3 script to parse a file_

There was a proposal on Upwork`s Job Feed. I sent an offer, but client didn`t answer me, so I`ve written this script 
"just for fun". Because of I did it for myself, I`ve a little changed programs behaviour in comparision with original 
task: in original task client asked about storing filenames as constants in code, but I implement filenames as 
arguments of command line (Unix/Linux, bash), using Python`s argparse module. You can see screenshots, sourcecode and 
console log, also I made small blockbuster movie with good music about this script: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEl_khZ6H8w .
Thank you! :-) :-) :-)
